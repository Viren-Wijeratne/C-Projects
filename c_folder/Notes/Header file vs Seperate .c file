When to Use Which Method?

*Header File Method:

When you need a separation of interface and implementation for better modularity, especially in larger projects or when creating libraries.
If multiple .c files need to use the same function, a header file ensures they all share the same function signature without duplication.
Ideal for reusable functions, like in a shared library or API.

*Separate .c File Method:

Suitable for small projects or tight coupling where only one file or a few files are involved.
Useful when you don't need to expose the function to many other files or you're just working on a small, self-contained program.
If you don't need a complex modular structure, this method is quicker to implement.
