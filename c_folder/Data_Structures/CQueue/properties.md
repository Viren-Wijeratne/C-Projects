Queue is a data structure implemented using already existing data structures.
In this example linked list is used.

head      tail
|         |
4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL

Here the new elements are added towards the tail side, where the newest element is added to the link between NULL and the tail

     head      tail
     |         |
4    5 -> 6 -> 7 -> NULL

The previous head is removed from the queue and shifted along the line, demonstrating the first in-first out principle
